# ðŸŒ¿ Phylogenetic Tree Comparison Tool

Most existing tools allow you to view **only one phylogenetic tree at a time**. This project solves that limitation by enabling you to load and compare **two trees side-by-side**, making it easier to visually spot differences and similarities between tree structures.

Our application supports both **linear** and **radial** views and provides interactive features to make comparison intuitive and fast.

## Our Application looks the following when two trees are loaded
